# Statistik mit R

During this statistics and data analysis training with R, I studied the following topics and completed exercises and a final project:

## Statistical basics

* Basis of measurement theory (population and sample, sample types, measurement and scale levels)
* Univariate descriptive statistics (frequency distributions, central measures, scatter measures, standard value, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, line charts and boxplots)
* Bivariate descriptive statistics (correlation measures, correlation coefficients, crosstabs, scatter plots and grouped bar charts)
* Basics of inductive inference statistics (probability distribution, normal distribution, mean value distribution, significance test, zero hypothesis test according to Fisher, effect size, parameter estimation, confidence intervals, error bar diagrams, power analyzes and determination of the optimal sample size)

## Methods for comparing two groups

* z and t test for a sample (deviation from a specified value)
* t-test for the mean difference between two independent / connected samples
* Checking the effectiveness of actions, measures, interventions and other changes with t-tests (pretest-posttest designs with two groups)
* Supporting significance tests (Anderson-Darling test, Ryan Joiner test, Levene test, Bonnet test, significance test for correlations)
* Nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon test, sign test, Mann-Whitney test)
* Contingency analyzes (binomial test, exact test according to Fisher, chi-square test, crosstabs with association measures)

## Methods for comparing the mean of several groups

* One and two factor analysis of variance (simple and balanced ANOVA)
* Multi-factorial analysis of variance (general linear model)
* Fixed, random, crossed and nested factors
* Multiple comparison procedure (Tukey-HSD, Dunnett, Hsu-MCB, Games-Howell)
* Interaction analysis (analysis of interaction effects)
* Selectivity and power analysis for analysis of variance

## Introduction to experiment planning (DoE, Design of Experiments)

* Full and partial factorial test plans

## [Project work](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/statistik-mit-R/tree/master/Final%20Project)

* to deepen the learned content
* Presentation of the project results
